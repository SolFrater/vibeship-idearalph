-- Seed data for development/testing
-- This file is run after migrations

-- Note: In development, users are created through the auth flow
-- These are just example ideas for testing the UI

-- You can add test data here when you have a test user ID
-- Example:
-- INSERT INTO ideas (user_id, name, raw_idea, dope_level, status)
-- VALUES
--   ('your-test-user-id', 'Dog Social Network', 'What if dogs had their own social media?', 3, 'sandbox'),
--   ('your-test-user-id', 'Reverse Uber', 'Uber but drivers pick where to go', 2, 'sandbox');
